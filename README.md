# DSalary-Predictor
A project designed to predict salaries for data science roles, utilizing Glassdoor job postings as a primary data source. 

When I applied to this master's program, I was encouraged by one statement - the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects jobs in the (data) field to grow more than 30 percent between 2020 and 2030. With graduation on the horizon, my focus has naturally evolved towards understanding the potential earnings within this burgeoning field. To address this, I will embark on a project designed to predict salaries for data science roles, utilizing Glassdoor job postings as a primary data source. This tool enables users to obtain personalized salary estimates by entering specific details such as their skills, work experience, geographical location, company size, and other relevant information.
