As our Data Scientist II, you will act as an internal business consultant to help optimize every facet of this organization. You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.What You’ll Do Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario.You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else.This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Coppell, TX, office for regular collaboration days.
What You’ll Need To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.You have worked previously with an Agile team or understand these concepts. You expect to participate in daily standup meetings, you’ll complete your projects or stories during our bimonthly sprints, and you’re ready to meet frequent deployment deadlines.
The starting pay range for this position is:$138,900.00 - $185,200.00Additionally, you will be eligible to participate in our incentive program based upon the achievement of organization, team and personal performance.Remarkable benefits:  Health coverage for medical, dental, vision 401(K) saving plan with company match AND Pension Tuition assistance PTO for community volunteer programs Wellness program Employee discounts

DescriptionAre you looking for a challenge? Imagine being part of a team that owns one of the largest supply chain simulation systems in the world to predict inventory flows for the millions of items available on Amazon.com worldwide. Inventory planning involves many algorithms to buy inventory in the right quantities, at the right frequencies, from the right vendors, and assigning to the best warehouse to fulfill customer demand to optimize long term free cash flow for Amazon. Our system lives at the heart of these algorithms, keeping up with the rapid pace of optimization improvements and simulating how they interact with each other. We simulate what these systems will do for months into the future, predicting inventory flows and key operational and financial metrics across the network. This experimentation platform is critical in understanding labor needs, managing our network capacity, and allowing continued optimizations to the many algorithms we simulate. Imagine enabling Amazons supply chain systems to make data driven decisions based on simulations of trillions of inventory events per day.Every time an Amazon customer makes a purchase, a number of systems are involved: these systems help optimize inventory acquisition, enable a number of purchase options, ensure great pricing, store products so they are available for fast delivery, and minimize package frustration. The Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) Group develops and manages these systems. We are central to Amazon customers ability to find what they want and get it when they want it. Within SCOT, the IPC Simulation team is responsible for designing and executing the simulations and experiments that measure the impact of SCOT initiatives, as well as predicting inventory flows for labor planning.We are looking for data scientists to drive innovation in SCOT by pushing IPC Simulation systems further upstream in the innovation process, developing new techniques and analytics for both experimentation and prediction use cases, and applying existing models to our problem space and beyond. As an Amazon Data Scientist, your work will impact on how we serve our customers so that they get the right product at the right time. In our team, you will be working in one of the worlds largest data warehouse environments. You need to be a sophisticated user of data querying tools and advanced quantitative and modeling techniques, and an expert at synthesizing and communicating insights and recommendations to audiences of varying levels of technical sophistication to drive change, as your work will be visible up to the highest business leaders in SCOT. You will perform deep dives across various system inputs/outputs and connect to key performance indicators through observational and simulation data, and detect anomalies to identify problems in our systems. Much of the job will require close collaboration with software development engineers, other scientists, and business teams to innovate for and solve problems of the future.We are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:Bellevue, WA, USABasic Qualifications  6+ years of data scientist or similar role involving data extraction, analysis, statistical modeling and communication experience 6+ years of data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python) or statistical/mathematical software (e.g. R, SAS, Matlab, etc.) experience Masters degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, data science, business analytics, economics, finance, engineering, or computer science, or Bachelors degree and 8+ years of professional or military experience Experience with statistical models e.g. multinomial logistic regression
